## üéØ Performance Overview

AgriLens AI's performance varies based on hardware configuration, with GPU acceleration providing significant speed improvements.

### Response Time by Hardware Configuration

| Hardware Configuration | Expected Response Time | Notes |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:------|
| **GPU + 16GB+ RAM** | < 10 seconds | **Optimal performance** |
| **GPU + 8-12GB RAM** | 15-30 seconds | **Excellent performance** |
| **16GB+ RAM (CPU only)** | < 30 seconds | Good performance |
| **8-12GB RAM (CPU only)** | 1-3 minutes | Acceptable performance |
| **4-8GB RAM (CPU only)** | 5-10 minutes | Slow performance |
| **< 4GB RAM (CPU only)** | 10-20 minutes | **Maximum wait time** |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Performance Notes

-   **GPU Advantage**: NVIDIA/AMD GPUs provide a 3-5x speed increase in diagnosis time.
-   **RAM is Critical**: The AI model demands substantial memory for efficient processing.
-   **First Run**: Initial model loading may take longer across all systems.
-   **Background Processes**: Close other applications to free up RAM and improve performance.
-   **Patience Required**: On devices with lower RAM, the diagnostic process can extend up to 20 minutes.
-   **No Interruption**: Avoid closing the application during analysis, even if it seems to be slow.

### Accuracy & Capabilities

-   **Accuracy**: High precision in diagnosis, powered by Gemma 3n.
-   **Memory**: Adaptive loading optimizes memory usage for various hardware configurations.
-   **Supported Plants**: Comprehensive coverage including vegetables, fruits, grains, ornamentals, and herbs.

## üîß Advanced Features

-   **Memory Management**: Automatic optimization for efficient resource utilization.
-   **Error Handling**: Robust graceful fallbacks ensure application stability.
-   **Export**: Generate detailed HTML and text reports of diagnosis results.
-   **Mobile Mode**: A simulated offline interface designed for seamless mobile use.
-   **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar with estimated completion time.
-   **Structured Output**: Enforced three-section format (symptoms, disease name, treatment).
-   **Context-Aware Analysis**: Integration of multiple user inputs for refined diagnosis.
-   **Performance Optimization**: 4-bit quantization, Flash Attention 2, and adaptive loading.
-   **Local Model Support**: Complete offline functionality with local model loading.
-   **Multimodal Processing**: Advanced image and text processing with Gemma 3n.
